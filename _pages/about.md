Hi, I am Haonan Ge (ËëõÊµ©Âçó) üëã, a senior undergraduate student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Information Engineering. I am currently collaborating remotely with [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) and [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) as a Research Intern. My work centers on agentic vision‚Äìlanguage models and reinforcement learning for adaptive perception, advised by [Prof. Yujun Cai](https://vanoracai.github.io/) and collaborating with [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/), [Prof. Yiwei Wang](https://wangywust.github.io/). 

Previously, I was a visiting student at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), working with [Prof. Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/) as a Research Intern. And I also co-led a vision-language model in sports-benchmark and reinforcement learning project with [Prof. Hanjie Chen](https://hanjiechen.github.io/index.html) at the [Chili Lab](https://hanjiechen.github.io/group.html), [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).
