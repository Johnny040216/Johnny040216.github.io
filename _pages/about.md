Hi, I am Haonan Ge ðŸ‘‹, a senior undergraduate student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Information Engineering. I am currently collaborating remotely with [University of California, Merce](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) and [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) as a Research Intern. My work centers on agentic visionâ€“language models and reinforcement learning for adaptive perception (FrameMind: FiCOT, DRFS-GRPO), advised by [Yujun Cai](https://vanoracai.github.io/) and collaborating with [Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/), [Yiwei Wang](https://wangywust.github.io/).
