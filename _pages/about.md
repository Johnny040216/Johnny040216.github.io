Hi, I am Haonan Ge (ËëõÊµ©Âçó) üëã, a senior undergraduate student at [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I currently work as a Research Intern with [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/) and [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/), advised by [Prof. Yujun Cai](https://vanoracai.github.io/) (UQ) and [Prof. Yiwei Wang](https://wangywust.github.io/) (UC Merced), and I collaborate with [Prof. Kai-Wei Chang](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) (UCLA) and Prof. [Ming-Hsuan Yang](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mhyang/) (UC Merced). 

Previously, I was a visiting student at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), working with [Prof. Weining Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/) as a Research Intern. And I also co-led a vision-language model in sports-benchmark and reinforcement learning project with [Prof. Hanjie Chen](https://hanjiechen.github.io/index.html) at the [Chili Lab](https://hanjiechen.github.io/group.html), [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/).

My research interests lie in the algorithmic foundations of reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and agentic reinforcement learning, with a focus on adaptive perception, tool-augmented planning-and-acting loops, and trustworthy, interpretable decision-making across images, video, and text. <span style="color:#dc2626">I am actively seeking a Ph.D. position beginning in Fall 2026! Feel free to email me if you are interested.</span>
